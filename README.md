Title : PHARMACY DATA BASE

Description: This project is about a pharmacy, its database has six tables: Clients, Clients Accounts, Orders, Medicines, Laboratory and one bridge table due the many-to-many relationship between Orders and Medicines.

I am using Django Python web framework, I have created my dockerfile, and my dockercompose file where I have implemented my multiple containers (pharmacy app, pgadmin and postgres).
